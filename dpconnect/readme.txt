Run the local script on a machine that you control.

Change the host variable in the remote script to the IP address of the machine running the server.

Run the remote script on the target machine (make sure you have proper authorization).

Once the remote connects to the local, you can use the local console to send commands to the remote, 
and the remote will execute them and send back the output. 

Be cautious when using reverse shells and ensure you have proper authorization before deploying such tools.
